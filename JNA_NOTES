I'm fairly certain this is the display they used: https://www.adafruit.com/product/250
Graphic ST7565 Positive LCD (128x64) with RGB backlight + extras - ST7565


NOTES--

Microcontroller must buffer display - uses 1Kb of RAM. This means you must upgrade to a ATmega328 if you are using an Arduino with a '8 or '168
For a more detailed tutorial, including how to wire up the display with a 4050, see our writeup at http://www.ladyada.net/learn/lcd/st7565.html
